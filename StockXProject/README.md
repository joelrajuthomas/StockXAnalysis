# Shoes

This is a project I'm doing with [Joel Thomas](https://github.com/joelrajuthomas).

Data is from [StockX](https://stockx.com/news/the-2019-data-contest/) on sales of the [Nike/Off-White collaboration](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/nike-off-white-guide/) and [Adidas Yeezy](https://yeezysupply.com/collections/yeezy-350-v2) shoes.

View notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brendanok/Shoes/blob/master/Untitled.ipynb) if github isn't showing the tables properly.
